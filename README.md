# Task-Fragmentation
AN assignment to test the fragmentation ability of Developers

My Pick - Fragmentation of UI

## My Reasons for Fragmentating it like that

Breaking down React code into smaller fragments makes it easier to manage and understand. It's like tidying up your room into smaller, more manageable sections so you can find things quickly.

Smaller components are like puzzle pieces that fit neatly together. This makes them easier to test individually, ensuring that each piece works correctly without causing problems elsewhere.

fragmented code allows multiple developers to work together seamlessly. Each person can focus on their part without stepping on each other's toes, leading to smoother teamwork.

When something needs fixing or updating, you can quickly locate the right tool without rummaging through a messy pile. This saves time and effort in the long run.
